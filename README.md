 ## Overview
 Image classification is an incredibly useful tool in regards to identifying small details or changes in previously existing data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are sets of different forms of layers that learn image features and classify them according to a dataset. The combination of convolutional, max pooling, flatten, and dense layers are used to search through image data and connect their previously existing neurons to predict the classificaiton of a given image.
